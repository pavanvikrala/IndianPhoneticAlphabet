# IndianPhoneticAlphabet

>> This project uses the knowledge of "list comprehensions" and "dictionary comprehensions" and creates a list of words from the letters in a
word which is difficult to understand for others over the phone call.
>> This was inspired by "NATO phonetic alphabet" and I used all the Indian terms for the alphabets.
>> This project showcases everything on streamlit application and we need to make sure every required module is installed.
>> Enjoy by running the code in your python IDE ğŸ˜Š
